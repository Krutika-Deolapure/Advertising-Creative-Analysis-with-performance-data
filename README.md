# AI Agent for Advertising Creative Analysis

## Objective
Develop an AI agent that analyzes a batch of advertising creatives along with their performance data. The goal is to provide actionable insights into the creative elements that correlate with performance outcomes.

## Design and Architecture
The AI agent is designed to perform the following tasks:
1. **Data Ingestion**: Upload and clean the dataset containing advertising creatives and their performance metrics.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Summarize and visualize the dataset to understand the distribution and relationships among different features.
3. **Performance Correlation**: Use advanced machine learning models to predict the performance of advertising creatives.
4. **Time Series Analysis**: Analyze trends in performance metrics over time.
5. **Automated Insights and Recommendations**: Generate insights and actionable recommendations based on the analysis.

## Limitations
- The analysis is limited to the features extracted and the performance metrics available.
- Results may vary based on the quality and quantity of the data provided.
- Content analysis for photos and videos has not been implemented due to the lack of data.
